# web-scrapping-from-153-links-and-performing-NLP-to-calculate-various-factors
details of links were given in an excel file. i converted those details into links and put the links in list. i then performed web scrapping on these 153 links. the data was not placed in order so i studied their pattern and accordingly data from each link was scrapped. after getting the data i calculated 16 different types of parameters for each link. the details of the parameters are given in file objective and Text analysis file. i downloaded three extra files which contained list of words which were needed for calculation of parameters. after calculating these parameters i converted that into a dataframe and joined it to the provided excel file for easier understanding. files present in problem statement are files that were given to solve and the rest of files are my solution for the problem statement.
